This includes:\n\n    * ANC \\>/= 1,500/mm3\n    * platelet count \\>/=100,000/mm3\n    * HgB ≥ 9 g/dL\n    * Creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN or creatinine clearance (measured via 24-hour urine collection) ≥40 mL/minute (that is, if serum creatinine is \\>1.5 times the ULN, a 24-hour urine collection to calculate creatinine clearance must be performed).\n    * Total Serum Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (Patients with known Gilbert Syndrome, a total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN, with direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN)\n    * SGOT, SGPT ≤ 3 X ULN if no liver metastasis present\n    * SGOT, SGPT ≤ 5 X ULN if liver metastasis present\n12. Females of childbearing potential must not be breast feeding and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of starting of treatment. The patient must agree to use adequate contraception for a minimum of two weeks prior to receiving study medication until 3 months after discontinuation of the study medication. Acceptable methods of contraception include total and true sexual abstinence, hormonal contraceptives that are not prone to drug-drug interactions (IUS Levonorgestrel Intra Uterine System (Mirena), Medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera)), copper-banded intra-uterine devices, and vasectomized partner. All hormonal methods of contraception should be used in combination with the use of a condom by their sexual male partner. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause). Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements must also apply: Women \\< 50 years old: they would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments. The levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) must also be in the post-menopausal range (as per the institution). Women ≥ 50 years old: they would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, or have had radiation-induced oophorectomy with the last menses \\> 1 year ago, or have had chemotherapy-induced menopause with \\>1 year interval since last menses, or have had surgical sterilization by either bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy.\n13. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and 3 months after the last dose of study medication. Adequate contraception methods include: birth control pills (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill), barrier protection (e.g. condom plus spermicide, cervical/vault cap or intrauterine device), and abstinence. Patients should not father a child for 6 months after completion of the study medication. Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months after discontinuing the study medication. If male patients wish to father children they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of the study medication.\n14. Participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active and their partners must agree to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Patients should not father a child during the study or for 6 months after completion of study treatment. Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months after discontinuing the study treatment. Two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method. See below for options:\n\nAcceptable non-hormonal birth control methods:\n\n* Total sexual abstinence ie, refrain from any form of sexual intercourse in line with the patients' usual and/or preferred lifestyle. Abstinence must be for the total duration as described above. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n* Vasectomised sexual partner PLUS male condom. With participant assurance that partner received post-vasectomy confirmation of azoospermia.\n* Tubal occlusion PLUS male condom\n* Intrauterine Device PLUS male condom. Provided coils are copper-banded.\n\nAcceptable hormonal methods:\n\n* Etonogestrel implants (eg, Implanon®, Norplant®) PLUS male condom\n* Normal and low dose combined oral pills PLUS male condom\n* Hormonal shot or injection (eg, Depo-Provera) PLUS male condom\n* Intrauterine system device (eg, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system - Mirena®) PLUS male condom\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Previous treatment with other aurora kinase inhibitors.\n2. Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic or stable for at least 2 weeks prior to start of study treatment.\n3. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than CTCAE grade 1 (with the exception of alopecia grade 2) at the time of starting study treatment.\n4. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases. Screening for chronic conditions is not required.\n5. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of osimertinib.\n6.

Other similar conditions may be discussed with and permitted by the medical monitor.\n\nSpecial Criteria Regarding Fertility and Contraception\n\nFemale subjects of reproductive potential (women who have reached menarche or women who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or have not undergone a sterilization procedure \\[hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy\\]) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed as part of eligibility criteria. Lactating women are eligible for this study but will be asked to not provide breast milk to their child from Day -4 through Day +90 after CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nDue to the high-risk level of this study, while enrolled, all subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). Additionally, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study subject must agree to use reliable and double barrier methods of contraception during the follow-up period of the protocol.\n\nAcceptable birth control includes a combination of two of the following methods:\n\n* Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent.\n* Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide.\n* Intrauterine device (IUD).\n* Hormonal-based contraception. Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (women who are premenarche or have been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy, tubal ligation, salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy or men who have documented azoospermia) are eligible without requiring the use of contraception.",

Resectable tumors are defined as having no significant vascular, neural or bony involvement. Only cases where a complete surgical resection can safely be achieved are defined as resectable.\n* Patients will be evaluated by the anesthesia team prior to surgery.\n* Patient must have recent imaging (computed tomography \\[CT\\] or magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\], as appropriate) within 4 weeks of trial enrollment, demonstrating measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.\n* Patients must have at least one tumor amenable to serial biopsy in clinic or be willing to undergo serial biopsies through image-guided procedures during the neoadjuvant phase of the protocol. Patients must be willing to provide tumor samples at the time points.\n* Patients must be medically fit to undergo surgery as determined by the treating medical and surgical oncology team and have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.\n* Patients must have life expectancy \\> 6 months.\n* Patients must be immunotherapy-naive.

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.\n* Childbearing potential and agrees to use method(s) of contraception. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in consultation with the investigator. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\n* WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]) within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product.\n* Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. The investigator shall review contraception methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. Therefore, men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 7 months (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\n* Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) and azoospermic men do not require contraception.\n* Women must not be breastfeeding.\n* Other terms for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) may include, but are not limited to: pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, unclassified spindle cell sarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma not otherwise specified, pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic fibroblastic sarcoma, undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma with prominent inflammation, pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (including storiform-pleomorphic and inflammatory subtypes), fibrosarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma (at least intermediate grade; located deep to the fascia in muscle).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Disease that is considered surgically unresectable, including, but not limited to significant vascular, neural, or bone involvement, and in cases where a complete surgical resection cannot be safely performed.\n* Prior intra-abdominal surgery within 4 weeks of trial enrollment.\n* Prior chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy of the current sarcoma. In patients with locally recurrent disease, previous systemic chemotherapy of the primary tumor is allowed, as long as treatment was completed prior to study enrollment and patient has recovered (i.e., \\< grade 1 or at baseline) from any adverse events due to previously administered agents.\n* Prior radiation therapy for sarcoma in the same area.\n* Active concurrent second malignancy.\n* Prior or concurrent immunotherapy, including treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody; tumor vaccines; interferon, or interleukins.\n* Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for patient's prior diagnosis of sarcoma and locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast with local control measures (surgery, radiation).\n* Non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious disease within 4 weeks of trial enrollment.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures required in the protocol.\n* Current use of anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors) at therapeutic levels.\n* Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.\n* Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease.

(Total bilirubin \\< 3 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's disease)\n* No signs of active coronary ischemia, including ECG changes or elevated troponin if clinically indicated\n* Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥30 mL/min based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation\n* All immune-related adverse events (irAE's) from prior ICI based therapy must have improved to Grade 1 or lower\n* All women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)\\* or sexually active men must practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Highly effective contraceptive measures in women include\n\n  o Stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening,\n  * Intrauterine device (IUD),\n  * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS),\n  * Bilateral tubal ligation,\n  * Vasectomized partner,† and/or\n  * Sexual abstinence.‡,§\n* Male study participants with WOCBP partners are required to use condoms unless they are vasectomized† or practice sexual abstinence.‡,§\n* \\* WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.\n\n  * Vasectomized partner or vasectomized study participant must have received medical assessment of the surgical success.\n\n    * Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.\n\n      * Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Uveal melanoma\n* Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal involvement; patients with brain metastases definitively treated with surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are permitted\n* Receipt of the following prior therapies:\n\n  * For Cohort A: Any prior anti-LAG-3 (e.g., relatlimab) or CTLA-4 (e.g., ipilimumab) directed therapy, unless it was given in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting and the last dose was given more than three months prior to disease recurrence\n  * For Cohort B: Any prior CTLA-directed therapy (e.g., ipilimumab), unless it was given in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting and the last dose was given more than three months prior to disease recurrence\n* Prior Grade 3 or greater neurologic toxicity associated with a prior line of ICI therapy\n* Any prior myocarditis associated with ICI therapy\n* Concurrent systemic steroid therapy higher than physiologic dose steroid replacement (\\>7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent), given within 14 days of starting treatment, or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of the start of treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n* Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study medication\n* Significant infection requiring systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks of the planned start of study medication (e.g., pneumonia, cellulitis)\n* Uncontrolled (i.e., unstable) concomitant medical condition or organ system dysfunction which, in the treating Investigator's opinion, could compromise the patient's safety or compliance with the study procedures.\n* Other active, concurrent malignancy that requires ongoing systemic treatment or interferes with radiographic assessment of melanoma response as determined by the treating investigator\n* History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any unknown allergens or any components of the study drugs (active ingredients or excipients)\n* Has uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection; or has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency. Notes:\n\n  * Patients will be tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) at screening.\n  * Patients with known HIV infection who have controlled infection (undetectable viral load (HIV RNA PCR) and CD4 count above 350 either spontaneously or on a stable antiviral regimen) are permitted. For patients with controlled HIV infection, monitoring will be performed per local standards.\n  * Patients with hepatitis B (HBsAg+) who have controlled infection (serum hepatitis B virus DNA PCR that is below the limit of detection and receiving anti-viral therapy for hepatitis B) are permitted. Patients with controlled infections must undergo periodic monitoring of HBV DNA. Patients must remain on anti-viral therapy for at least 6 months beyond the last dose of investigational study drug.\n  * Patients who are hepatitis C virus antibody positive (HCV Ab+) who have controlled infection (undetectable HCV RNA by PCR either spontaneously or in response to a successful prior course of anti-HCV therapy) may be enrolled into the study.\n* Patients who are breastfeeding or who are pregnant as evidenced by a positive serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) performed within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.\n* Prisoners or participants who are involuntarily incarcerated. (Note: Under certain specific circumstances where local regulations permit, a person who has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue as a participant.)\n* Participants who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness (e.g., transmissible infection)",

Has clinically active brain metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms. However, subjects with asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are radiologically and neurologically stable for at least 4 weeks following CNS-directed therapy, and who are on stable or decreasing doses of corticosteroids equivalent to ≤10 mg/day prednisone are eligible for study entry.\n16. Has unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Subjects with chronic Grade 2 toxicities (e.g., Grade 2 neuropathy) may be eligible based on the discussion and agreement between Investigator and Sponsor.\n17. Has multiple primary malignancies within 3 years before enrollment, except adequately resected non-melanoma skin cancer (e.g., resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer), curatively treated in-situ disease (e.g., carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast), other solid tumors curatively treated (e.g., superficial bladder cancer), or contralateral breast cancer.\n18. Has substance abuse or any other medical conditions that would increase the safety risk to the subject or interfere with participation or evaluation of the clinical study in the opinion of the investigator.\n19. Has known hypersensitivity to either the drug substances or inactive ingredients in the drug product.\n20. Patients with other reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator, make them unsuitable to participate in this study.\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.",

Patient has a MAPK pathway-altered solid tumor(s), including but not limited to KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MEK, and ERK mutations.\n* Other Inclusion Criteria:\n\n  1. In the opinion of the treating physician, the patient has exhausted or has inadequate response to available anti-cancer treatments.\n  2. In the opinion of the treating physician, the patient has adequate organ function to tolerate ulixertinib as defined in section 6.1\n  3. Male or female patients aged ≥ 12 years.\n  4. Patient must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication.\n\n     Note: Ulixertinib is primarily absorbed in the duodenum and therefore patients with any prior stomach or duodenal resection should be evaluated with that understanding.\n  5. For females, evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for pre-menopausal patients.\n  6. Highly effective contraception for both male and female patients throughout the treatment and for at least 4 months after last treatment administration. In patients under the age of 18, who are not sexually active, abstinence is an acceptable form.\n  7. Toxicities related to any prior treatments are either stable, stable on supportive therapy, resolved, or in the opinion of the treating physician, clinically non-significant\n  8. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign it. Assent will be obtained when appropriate based on the patient's age.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient is already participating in or qualifies for and is able to enroll in a clinical trial of ulixertinib (BVD-523).\n2. Patient has received systemic therapy with an investigational agent within 5 half-lives or 14 days prior to starting ulixertinib treatment, whichever is shorter.\n3. Patient has received radiotherapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of ulixertinib treatment other than for the allowable treatment of symptomatic bone metastasis.\n4. A history of current evidence/risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR)\n5. Current evidence of uncontrolled, significant intercurrent illness that would, in the treating physician's judgment, contraindicate the patient's treatment with ulixertinib due to safety concerns.\n6. Patients who, in the opinion of the treating physician, have not fully recovered from recent major surgery to a sufficient extent to tolerate treatment with ulixertinib.\n7. Known hypersensitivity to ulixertinib or any component in its formulation.\n8. Patients taking prohibited medications as described in current Investigator's Brochure.\n\n   Note: Patients who require treatment with Drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 (see Appendix 3) were excluded from the FIH study of ulixertinib and should be discussed with xCures to review if any potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.\n9. Patient is actively breastfeeding.\n10. Prior stomach or duodenal resection that in the opinion of the treating physician would affect the breakdown and absorption of ulixertinib.",

Participants with uteri must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for at least one month after the last dose of AMG 510. Participants with sperm must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for at least 3 months after the last dose of AMG 510. Participants are considered to be of \"reproductive potential\" if they have had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months and no prior oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" for participants with uteri also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. Acceptable methods of birth control for participants with sperm include sexual abstinence (refraining from heterosexual intercourse); vasectomy with testing showing there is no sperm in the semen; bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion in the partner; or a condom (the female partner should also consider a form of birth control). However, if at any point a previously celibate participant chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures",

PDAC, CRC, Other tumor types: Confirmed KRAS mutation, any variant\n  2. NSCLC: Confirmed KRAS mutation, any variant except previously treated G12C. If driver mutation, must have failed precision medicine therapy \\[eg, inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), and others\\].\n* Part 1 and Part 2a: Participant must have progressed on standard treatment(s) for which no additional, effective therapy is available.\n\n  1. PDAC (2-3L): Participants must have received and radiologically progressed on prior lines of systemic therapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. If participants received prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and progressed within 6 months of the last dose, then this should be considered as a prior line of systemic therapy.\n  2. NSCLC (2-3L): Participants must have received prior lines of anti-cancer treatment and progressed on at least a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen and checkpoint inhibitor therapy; for participants with EGFR, ALK, or other genomic tumor alterations, participants must have progressed on approved therapy for these alterations.\n  3. CRC (2-3L): Participants must have had one or two prior systemic treatment regimens for mCRC. For either one or two prior treatments, these regimens must have included a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan; for one prior treatment, exposure to VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor is optional;\n  4. Other tumors: Participants, in the judgment of the investigator, must have progressed or become intolerant to all available standard therapies, or have refused such therapy.\n* Part 2b:\n\n  1. PDAC (1L) Cohort A2: Participants must not have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Participant could have received neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, or adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, as long as relapse did not occur within 6 months of completing these forms of adjuvant treatment. If so, the relapse within 6 months would be considered a line of therapy; the participant would be considered 2L, and not 1L.\n  2. CRC (2-3L) Cohort B2: Participants must have had one or two prior systemic treatment regimens for mCRC. For either one or two prior treatments, these regimens must have included a fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin; for one prior treatment, exposure to a VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor is optional.\n  3. CRC (1L) Cohort B3: Participants must not have had prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Participant could have received adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, as long as relapse did not occur within 6 months of complete of adjuvant therapy. If so, the relapse within 6 months would be considered a line of therapy; the participant would be considered 2L, and not 1L.\n  4. NSCLC (1L) Cohort C2: Participants must have a TPS ≥50% and must not have received prior systemic treatment setting.\n  5. NSCLC (1L) Cohort C3: Participants with any TPS and must not have received prior systemic treatment setting.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active or history of pneumonitis/ILD, pulmonary fibrosis requiring treatment with systemic steroid therapy, including evidence to suggest pneumonitis/ILD on baseline assessments including imaging.\n* Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or an active autoimmune disease that require systemic treatment with chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy in the past 2 years.\n* Sensory peripheral neuropathy ≥Grade 2\n* Active or history of clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) disease (including but not limited to inflammatory GI disease \\[eg, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease\\], immune-mediated colitis, peptic ulcer disease, GI bleeding, chronic diarrhea) and other conditions that are unresolved and/or may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment administration.\n* Active bleeding disorder, including GI bleeding, as evidenced by hematemesis, significant hemoptysis or melena in the past 6 months.\n* Major surgery or completion of radiation therapy ≤4 weeks prior to enrollment/randomization or radiation therapy that included \\>30% of the bone marrow.\n* Known sensitivity or contraindication to any component of study intervention (PF 07934040, gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, cetuximab, bevacizumab, FOLFOX, 5-FU, pembrolizumab, cisplatin, carboplatin, pemetrexed, SHP2 inhibitor(s), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor(s), antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) or EGFR inhibitor(s)).\n* Hematologic abnormalities.\n* Renal impairment.\n\n  * Hepatic abnormalities.",

Confirmed diagnosis of a malignancy harbouring any actionable BRAF V600 mutation using an analytically validated next-generation sequencing method.\n\nB. Adult patients ≥18 years old.\n\nC. Patients must be able and willing to undergo a fresh tissue biopsy at baseline and blood samples for translational research. Note that for patients with haematological malignancies or neuroblastomas, blood, bone marrow aspiration and/or trephine or lymph node biopsy samples may be taken.\n\nD. Adequate organ function as per haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges defined in the protocol. These measurements should be performed to confirm the patient's eligibility.\n\nE. Women of childbearing potential are eligible provided that they meet the following criteria:\n\n* Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and;\n* Agree to sexual abstinence OR to use any two forms of highly effective or effective methods together (at least one to be non-hormonal) such as:\n\n  * Highly effective methods:\n* combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)\n* progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable)\n* intrauterine device (IUD)\n* intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\n* bilateral tubal occlusion\n* vasectomised partner\n\n  * Effective methods:\n* progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception not associated with inhibition of ovulation\n* male or female condom with or without spermicide\n* cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide\n\nEffective from the first administration of vemurafenib or cobimetinib (whichever is first), throughout the trial and for six months after the last administration of vemurafenib or cobimetinib (whichever is later).\n\nF. Male patients with partners who are women of childbearing potential, are eligible provided that they agree to the following, from the first administration of vemurafenib or cobimetinib (whichever is first), throughout the trial and for six months after the last administration of vemurafenib or cobimetinib (whichever is later):\n\n* Agree to take measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception (condom plus spermicide) or to sexual abstinence\n* Non-vasectomised male patients with partners who are women of childbearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner uses a highly effective method of contraception as in E, above.\n* Male patients with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier method contraception (e.g. condom) to prevent drug exposure of the foetus or neonate.\n\nAll male patients must refrain from donating sperm for the same period.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA. Diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.\n\nB. Female patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the trial or for six months following their last dose of vemurafenib or cobimetinib, whichever is later.\n\nC. Patients with QTcF (Corrected QT interval by Fridericia) at screening of \\>450 ms for males and \\>470 ms for females measured on triplicate ECG (if 1/3 readings show \\>450/470 ms then patient is ineligible).\n\nD.

Any T \\[Tx, T1, T2, T3, or T4-\\], N1-2M0.\n* Participants must have completely resected disease. In patients with tumor adherent to adjacent structures, en block RO resection must be documented.\n* Entire tumor must be in the colon (rectal involvement is excluded).\n* Participants must have completed standard adjuvant chemotherapy per the discretion of the treating physician. Standard therapy includes FOLFOX, CAPOX, or therapy with 5FU analog alone will be permitted if it constitutes appropriate standard therapy in the opinion of the treating physician.\n* Participants must not have received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n* Age ≥18 years.\n* ECOG performance status ≤1.\n* Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL\n  * platelets ≥100,000/ mcL\n  * total bilirubin within normal institutional limits. For patients with Gilbert's syndrome, total bilirubin must be ≤ 2 and documented as elevated indirect bilirubin.\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3 (AST) or ≤ 3 (ALT) × institutional upper limit of normal\n  * creatinine within normal institutional limits OR\n  * creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal by Cockroft-Gault formula.\n* In order to be eligible for the ctDNA positive cohort, women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG).\n* The effects on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because 5FU, Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, Leucovorin, Nivolumab, and Cetuximab are known to be teratogenic, in order to be eligible for the ctDNA positive cohort, females of child-bearing potential (FOCBP) and males must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or use 2 forms of effective contraception (fail rate of less than 1% per year, hormonal or barrier method of birth control) from time of informed consent until 5 months (FOCBP) and 7 months (males) after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women who are not of childbearing potential, ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men, do not require contraception.\n* Participants must have documentation of microsatellite instability status.

Note: Patients who have a total bilirubin level 1.5 × ULN will be allowed if their indirect bilirubin level is ≤ 1.5 × ULN; Alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 × ULN).\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test at the baseline visit. For this trial, women of childbearing potential are defined as all women after puberty, unless they are postmenopausal for at least 12 months, are surgically sterile, or are sexually inactive. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.\n* Subjects and their partners must be willing to avoid pregnancy during the trial and until a specific time interval after the last trial treatment: 7 months for female and 4 for male patients after last dose of trastuzumab-deruxtecan, 3 months for durvalumab, botensilimab and balstilimab and 2 months for panitumumab. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential and female subjects of childbearing potential must, therefore, be willing to use adequate contraception as approved by the Investigator (barrier contraceptive measure or oral contraception).\n* Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other study procedures.\n\nSpecific inclusion criteria for each Cohort\n\nCOHORT 1: pMMR/MSS status and HER2-positive status and LVEF ≥ 50% within 28 days before enrolment, international normalised ratio or Prothrombin time and either partial thromboplastin or activated partial thromboplastin time ≤ 1.5 × ULN\n\nCOHORT 2: Proofread domain mutations in POLE or POLD1 associated with ultra-mutated status, i.e. tumor mutational burden \\>100 Mut/Mb.\n\nCOHORT 3: pMMR/MSS status and wild-type status for RAS and BRAF, absence of molecular predictors of resistance (PRESSING panel negative), Left-sided and rectal primary tumor location, according to the specific inclusion criterion regarding rectal tumors.\n\nCOHORT 4: pMMR/MSS status and absence of HER2 overexpression/amplification, absence of POLE/D1 proof-read domain pathogenic mutation associated with ultra-mutated status and absence of KRAS G12C mutation.\n\nCOHORT 5: pMMR/MSS status and absence of of HER2 overexpression/amplification, absence of POLE/D1 proof-read domain pathogenic mutation associated with ultra-mutated status.\n\nCOHORT 6: dMMR/MSI-H status and absence of POLE/D1 proof-read domain pathogenic mutation associated with ultra-mutated status.\n\nCOHORT 7: dMMR/MSI-H status and absence of POLE/D1 proof-read domain pathogenic mutation associated with ultra-mutated status.\n\nCOHORT 8: pMMR/MSS status and KRAS G12C mutation, absence of HER2 overexpression/amplification and wild-type status for BRAF.\n\nCOHORT 9: pMMR/MSS status and absence of of HER2 overexpression/amplification, absence of POLE/D1 proof-read domain pathogenic mutation associated with ultra-mutated status, absence of KRAS G12C mutation.\n\nCOHORT 10: pMMR/MSS status and absence of of HER2 overexpression/amplification, absence of POLE/D1 proof-read domain pathogenic mutation associated with ultra-mutated status, absence of KRAS G12C mutation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nGeneral exclusion criteria\n\n* Distant metastases at any site, as defined by negativity of chest/abdomen/pelvis contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT).\n* Risk criteria for obstructing disease at radiology or endoscopy as defined in the pivotal FOxTROT study.\n* Need to receive neoadjuvant radiation or chemoradiation in patients with rectal cancer.\n* Patients with known hypersensitivity to the study drug of the assigned cohort or to its excipients or to drugs belonging to the same drug class.\n* Previous or concurrent malignancy within 2 years of study entry.\n* Impaired cardiovascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular diseases, including any of the following: history of acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary angioplasty or stenting) ≤ 6 months prior to start of study treatment; symptomatic congestive heart failure (i.e., Grade 2 or higher), history or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia and/or conduction abnormality ≤ 6 months prior to start of study treatment, except atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.\n* Known history of HIV infection.\n* Active infection including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C.

Anticancer treatment within 14 days before the start of trial treatment, e.g., cytoreductive therapy, radiotherapy (except for palliative bone-directed radiotherapy), immune therapy, or cytokine therapy.\n7. Major surgery within 28 days before the start of trial treatment (excluding prior diagnostic biopsy).\n8. Participants with a medical history of myocardial infarction within six months before treatment, symptomatic CHF (New York Heart Association Class II to IV), unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, or a recent (\\< 6 months) cardiovascular event, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, and stroke.\n9. Gastrointestinal perforation, fistula, or any arterial thromboembolic event within six months, or any significant gastrointestinal bleeding or significant venous thromboembolism within three months prior to treatment (except for stable venous thromboembolism on ongoing appropriate anticoagulation treatment).\n10. History of (non-infectious) ILD/pneumonitis, current ILD/pneumonitis, or where suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.\n11. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within seven days before the first dose of the study drug.\n12. Participants have a known previous or concurrent malignancy that has progressed or required active treatment within the past five years.\n\n    Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g., breast carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ) who have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.\n13. Toxicities from previous anticancer therapies should have resolved to baseline levels or Grade 1 or less prior to the first dose of study treatment (except for alopecia or post-radiation skin changes \\[any grade\\], and Grade ≤2 hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement).\n14. The participant has had prior chemotherapy or targeted cancer therapy with an investigational anticancer agent within two weeks or four half-lives, whichever is longer, before the first administration of the study drug.\n15. Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (e.g., compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.",

DOSE ESCALATION ONLY: For patients with ovarian cancer in the dose escalation cohort, only patients with recurrent, platinum resistant disease are eligible to enroll on study. Platinum resistance is defined as progression within 6 months from completion of platinum based therapy (the date should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum therapy). In addition, patients in this cohort with a BRCA mutation must have also progressed after treatment with PARP inhibitor.\n* Patients may have unlimited prior chemotherapeutic regimens for management of recurrent endometrial or ovarian carcinoma. Patients who have received prior PARP inhibitors ARE allowed to participate. Patients who have received prior PI3K-pathway inhibitors ARE allowed to participate on the dose escalation phase ONLY. Patients may have progressed on prior PARP inhibitor and/or PI3K-pathway inhibitor but they may not have discontinued drug for toxicity.\n* With the exception of alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, and bone marrow parameters, any unresolved toxicities from prior chemotherapy should be no greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0) grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment.\n* Patients should have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. If no measurable disease is present, patients should have assessable disease such as pleural effusion, ascites, with CA125 Gynecological Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria.\n* Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* The effects of niraparib and copanlisib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to taking study treatment. Female patients and their male partners must also agree to use effective contraception when sexually active. This applies since signing of the informed consent form and 6 months (for women of child bearing potential) after the last study drug administration. A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.\n* A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy. The investigator or a designated associate must advise the patient (WOCBP or men who have not undergone bilateral orchidectomy) how to achieve highly effective birth control method. Birth control should be used from the signing of the patient consent form and for 180 days following the last dose of niraparib. Acceptable methods of birth control include:\n\n  * Two highly effective forms of contraception, defined as contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Patients and their sexual partners who've undergone vasectomy or tubal occlusion must also use a male condom with spermicide.\n  * Permanent sterilization, defined as hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral orchidectomy; postmenopausal, defined as a female patient or sexual partner \\> 45 years of age who has not menstruated for at least 12 consecutive months; total sexual abstinence.\n* It is unknown if niraparib or copanlisib are expressed in human breast milk. For this reason, women must not breast-feed while taking the study medications.\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\>= 1,500/mcL (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9 gm/dL (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcL (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization) (\\< 2 x ULN for patients with Gilbert-Meulengracht syndrome or for patients with cholestasis due to compressive adenopathies of the hepatic hilum).\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =\\< 2.5 x ULN unless the liver is involved with tumor, in that case, ALT/AST must be =\\< 5 x ULN (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* Lipase =\\< 1.5 x ULN (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).\n* International normalized ratio (INR) =\\< 1.5 x ULN and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =\\< 1.5 x ULN (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization).

Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2\n* Patients must have disease that can be objectively measured by physical or radiographic exam (per RECIST v1.1 for solid tumor, Lugano criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma or International Myeloma Working Group criteria for multiple myeloma), defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or a subcutaneous or superficial lesion that can be measured with calipers by clinical exam. For lymph nodes, the short axis must be ≥15 mm. Patient's whose disease cannot be objectively measured by physical or radiographic examination (e.g., elevated serum tumor marker only, bone-only disease without an identifiable soft tissue component, or patients with only assessable non-measurable disease) are NOT eligible.\n* Results must be available from a genomic test or immunohistochemistry (IHC) test for protein expression performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited or New York State accredited (for labs offering services to residents of NY) laboratory. Labs that have registered the test with the NIH Genetic Testing Registry or that provide a report that has been designated as optimized for TAPUR participation are preferred, but not required. The genomic or IHC test used to qualify a patient for participation in TAPUR may have been performed on any specimen of the patient's tumor obtained at any point during the patient's care at the discretion of the patient's treating physician. Genomic assays performed on cell-free DNA in plasma (\"liquid biopsies\") will also be acceptable if the genomic analysis is performed in a laboratory that meets the criteria described above.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent/assent document.\n* Have a tumor genomic profile for which single agent treatment with one of the FDA approved targeted anti-cancer drugs included in this study has potential clinical benefit based on the criteria described in protocol.\n* For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.\n* Because of the risks of drug treatment to the developing fetus, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation, and for four months following completion of study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study or if she is the partner of a male participant in this study and becomes pregnant while he is participating in this study, she should inform her or her partner's treating physician immediately as well as her obstetrician. Female study patients who become pregnant must immediately discontinue treatment with any study therapy. Male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. Male study patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e. post-vasectomy) must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and for a specified amount of time the last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from sexual intercourse.\n\nNote: TAPUR does not explicitly exclude any type of solid tumor, but the patient must have measurable and evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients whose disease is not measurable or cannot be assessed by radiographic imaging or physical examination (e.g., elevated serum tumor marker only) are not eligible\n* Patients with primary brain tumors or leptomeningeal metastases are excluded.\n* Patients with previously treated brain metastases are eligible, provided that the patient has not experienced a seizure or had a clinically significant change in neurological status within the 3 months prior to registration. All patients with previously treated brain metastases must be clinically stable for at least 1 month after completion of treatment and off steroid treatment for one month prior to study enrollment.\n* Patients with known progressive brain metastases are eligible but additional eligibility criteria apply.\n\nNote: there are additional exclusion criteria that may apply",

In questionable cases, the patient must have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value \\>40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value \\<40 pg/mL (\\<140 pmol/L).\n\nFemale patients determined not to be post-menopausal must use adequate contraception, as defined immediately above for females of childbearing potential.\n\nFemale subjects who are lactating must discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of program treatment and must refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 4 months following the last dose of program treatment.\n\nIf a subject becomes pregnant during the treatment period of the program, the treatments should be stopped immediately.\n\nWritten patient informed consent must be obtained by the Treating Physician prior to start of treatment in accordance with the applicable local regulatory requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients eligible for this Treatment Plan must not meet any of the following criteria:\n\n1. Uveal or mucosal melanoma.\n2. Female who is pregnant or nursing (patient must discontinue nursing in order to enroll in the program).\n\n   NOTE: Safety and efficacy in pregnant or nursing women has not been investigated. Inclusion of pregnant or nursing woman may be considered in individually upon review by the Novartis Country Pharma Organization Medical Advisor/Director.\n3. Patients who have any lab abnormalities or AE/SAEs greater than Grade 3 (CTCAE v5.0)\n4. Concurrent treatment with other systemic anti-cancer therapies is not allowed, with the exception of whole brain radiation and brain radiosurgery. Patients who are currently being treated with another systemic anti-cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, immune, biologic, or targeted therapy) must discontinue use prior to initiation of treatment with trametinib and dabrafenib. NOTE: Radiation skin injury has been reported with concurrent use of dabrafenib and radiation. All AEs/SAEs related to WBRT (whole brain radiation) or brain radiosurgery are required to resolve to Grade 1 or less (CTCAE v5.0) prior to start of the Managed Access Program treatment.\n5. Patients who have received prior therapy with a BRAF inhibitor other than dabrafenib.\n\n   NOTE: Consideration may be given to those patients who have either (1) received prior BRAF therapy and there is disease progression in the CNS only or (2) discontinued prior BRAF therapy due to an adverse event that is not likely to recur in response to treatment with Dabrafenib\n6. Presence of any malignancy with confirmed activating RAS mutation. NOTE: Prospective RAS testing is not required. However, if the results of previous RAS testing are known, they must be used in assessing eligibility.\n7. Has a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to trametinib or dabrafenib, or excipients or to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n8. Any medical conditions or physical examination or clinical laboratory findings which would put the patient at high risk for an adverse outcome.\n9. Current evidence / risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy.\n10. Current evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:\n\n    * LVEF\\<LLN\n    * A QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Bazett's formula greater or equal to 480 msec;\n    * Clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias\n    * Acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction and unstable angina).\n    * Congestive heart failure ≥ Class II as defined by New York Heart Association\n11.

Confirmed diagnosis of a malignancy harbouring any actionable BRAF V600 mutation using an analytically validated next-generation sequencing method.\n\nB. Adult patients ≥18 years old.\n\nC. Patients must be able and willing to undergo a fresh tissue biopsy at baseline and blood samples for translational research. Note that for patients with haematological malignancies or neuroblastomas, blood, bone marrow aspiration and/or trephine or lymph node biopsy samples may be taken.\n\nD. Adequate organ function as per haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges defined in the protocol. These measurements should be performed to confirm the patient's eligibility.\n\nE. Women of childbearing potential are eligible provided that they meet the following criteria:\n\n* Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and;\n* Agree to sexual abstinence OR to use any two forms of highly effective or effective methods together (at least one to be non-hormonal) such as:\n\n  * Highly effective methods:\n* combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)\n* progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable)\n* intrauterine device (IUD)\n* intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\n* bilateral tubal occlusion\n* vasectomised partner\n\n  * Effective methods:\n* progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception not associated with inhibition of ovulation\n* male or female condom with or without spermicide\n* cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide\n\nEffective from the first administration of vemurafenib or cobimetinib (whichever is first), throughout the trial and for six months after the last administration of vemurafenib or cobimetinib (whichever is later).\n\nF. Male patients with partners who are women of childbearing potential, are eligible provided that they agree to the following, from the first administration of vemurafenib or cobimetinib (whichever is first), throughout the trial and for six months after the last administration of vemurafenib or cobimetinib (whichever is later):\n\n* Agree to take measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception (condom plus spermicide) or to sexual abstinence\n* Non-vasectomised male patients with partners who are women of childbearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner uses a highly effective method of contraception as in E, above.\n* Male patients with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier method contraception (e.g. condom) to prevent drug exposure of the foetus or neonate.\n\nAll male patients must refrain from donating sperm for the same period.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nA. Diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.\n\nB. Female patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the trial or for six months following their last dose of vemurafenib or cobimetinib, whichever is later.\n\nC. Patients with QTcF (Corrected QT interval by Fridericia) at screening of \\>450 ms for males and \\>470 ms for females measured on triplicate ECG (if 1/3 readings show \\>450/470 ms then patient is ineligible).\n\nD. Patients with any history of long QT syndrome or Torsades de Pointes (or any concurrent medication with a known risk of inducing Torsades de Pointes).\n\nE. Known hypersensitivity to vemurafenib or cobimetinib or any of the excipients.\n\nF. Patients unable to swallow vemurafenib and cobimetinib intact, without chewing or crushing the tablets (as per the dosing schedule).\n\nG. Patients who were administered a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrolment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during vemurafenib and cobimetinib treatment or within six months after the final dose of vemurafenib and cobimetinib.\n\nH. Patients with clinically significant pre-existing cardiac conditions including (within the last three months prior to screening):\n\n* Uncontrolled or symptomatic angina,\n* Uncontrolled atrial or ventricular arrhythmias,\n* Class III \\& IV New York Heart Association congestive heart failure,\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\<50%,\n* Myocardial infarction\n\nI. Ophthalmological disorders: History of retinal detachment, severe visual impairment, central serous chorioretinopathy, neovascular retinopathy, or retinopathy of prematurity.\n\nPatients with low grade gliomas causing visual impairment may be considered eligible and monitored with close ophthalmological monitoring.\n\nJ. History of pancreatitis.\n\nK. History of central nervous system (CNS) or gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage within three months of trial entry.\n\nL. Patients with any history of haemorrhagic stroke.\n\nM. Prior treatment with the same class of drug unless presence of a resistance alteration known to be potentially sensitive to either vemurafenib or cobimetinib. Prior sorafenib use is permissible following a washout period of 10 days.\n\nN. Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition (or its treatment) that could interfere with the conduct of the trial or absorption of oral medications that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the patient in this trial.\n\nO. Known active infections (bacterial, fungal or viral) that would interfere with the assessment of safety or efficacy of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity. Patients with history of testing positive for HIV infection are eligible provided the each of the following conditions are met:\n\n* CD4 count ≥350/μL;\n* undetectable viral load;\n* receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) that does not interact with IMP (patients should be on established ART for at least four weeks); and\n* no HIV/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated opportunistic infection in the last 12 months.",
